## OS-Railway

The main repositories can be found on [my own git](https://git.mars3142.dev/os-railway). The repositories within this company are just clones, so we can see stars, issues and other things. 

It's also here, because we wanted to host the [documentation](https://os-railway.mars3142.dev) somewhere, but we will move it into the [wiki](https://wiki.mars3142.dev) in the future.
